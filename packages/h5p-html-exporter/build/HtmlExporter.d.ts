 * Creates standalone HTML packages that can be used to display H5P in a browser

 * The bundle includes all JavaScript files, stylesheets, fonts of the H5P core
 * and all libraries used in the content. It also includes base64 encoded
 * resources used in the content itself. This can make the files seriously big,
 * if the content includes video files or lots of high-res images.
 *
 * The bundle does NOT internalize resources that are included in the content
 * via absolute URLs but only resources that are part of the H5P package.
 *
 * The HTML exports work with all content types on the official H5P Hub, but
 * there might be unexpected issues with other content types if they behave
 * weirdly and in any kind of non-standard way.
 *
 * The exported bundle contains license information for each file put into the
 * bundle in a shortened fashion (only includes author and license name and not
 * full license text).
 *
 * (important!) You need to install these NPM packages for the exporter to work:
 * postcss, postcss-clean, postcss-url, postcss-safe-parser, uglify-js
